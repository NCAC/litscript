## What Is It?

_LiTScript_ is a documentation generation tool that draws inspiration
from [literate programming][]. It extracts documentation from [TypeScript][] 
projects and produces feature-rich web sites. Its goal is to make creating
and maintaining project documentation as effortless as possible.

## Documentation

## Version 1.2

NPM packages. It should get rid of all the security warnigs, and be fully 
compatible with version 1.1. If you encounter any issues, please report them.
